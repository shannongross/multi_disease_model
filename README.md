This repository contains master's thesis work to complete Engineering and Policy Analysis program at TU Delft. The thesis can be viewed in the *results* directory.
* The *model* directory contains a system dynamics model for evaluating different public health policy options for combatting multiple infectious diseases in a population. The model is implemented in Vensim DSS.
* The model is extensively analyzed using the *exploratory modeling workbench*, which is available at: https://github.com/quaquel/EMAworkbench. Specifically, the analysis follows the *MORDM* approach outlined by
Kasprzyk et al. (2013) https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envsoft.2012.12.007.
